You wake up lost in the woods, with no recollection what happened, you see a man heavily injured. He looks like he's about to bleed out. 
You can't help but notice there's a girl out in the woods by herself. She holding something. You feel vigilant.
As you traverse through the woods, you notice a house oddly in the woods. You can hear noises, sounds like screaming and loud banging. You quiver.
Finally, you find a way out in the woods only to be approached by what it seems like a dark figure. You feel your life is in danger and you've been through enough horrors in the forest.
